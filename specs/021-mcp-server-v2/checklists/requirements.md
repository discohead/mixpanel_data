# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Server v2 - Intelligent Analytics Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

### Validation Summary

| Category | Items | Passed | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 8 | PASS |
| Feature Readiness | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **PASS** |

### Key Observations

1. **No clarifications needed**: All design decisions were pre-specified by user:
   - Graceful degradation when sampling unavailable
   - In-memory storage (no Redis)
   - All Tier 2/3 tools always available (no feature flags)

2. **30 functional requirements** covering all 7 phases of the implementation plan

3. **11 user stories** prioritized P1-P3 with clear acceptance scenarios

4. **10 measurable success criteria** that are technology-agnostic
